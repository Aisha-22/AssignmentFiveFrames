>What is Frames and why there is a special way of handling Frames in Selenium webdriver
What is Frames?
In the context of a web browser, a frame is a part of a web page or browser window which displays content independent of its container, with the ability to load content independently.
> Frames are a component which are hosted on the web pages = that is independent of the HTML Code
> Whenever there is a frame such as placing a container in a box -> Selenium can not identify the frames -> If you see Frames you can not handle that in a normal function,
you need to tell selenium that that is in frames so handle it accordingly you need to tell selenium that, if you dont it will this that this 'id' is a part of this web browser
> and it checks entire html code and you will not find it.
